Selenium Class 2

What is a WebElement
-Anything we see in a webpage is consider to be a webelement
e.g buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

HTML
HyperText Markup language


DOM / DevelopersTools
- stands for Document Object Model
- it is the internal browsers view of the webpage
- also called Developers tool / Dev tool
-Document-> can stored any document as pdf,excel
-Object-> any line in HTML is considered as Object
-Model-> it is just a layout of the HTML

locator
is an adress or a possition of an webelement on the webpage
is used to locate or identify webelements on webpage
address or a position of an web element on web page


8 locators
-ID  = best to use most unique
-Name
-TagName
-Xpath
-Linktext
-partialLinktext
-Css Selector
-ClassName

HTML scripting meaning
purple--tag
brown--attributes
blue--attribute values

Why do we need many locators ?
-some locators might have duplicate values in other nodes
-Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-some locators may not be applicable for element we are looking for
e.g link text and patiallinktext is only used for link

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag
linktext in selenium is used to identify the hyperlinks on the webpage. determin with help of an anchortag could be "a tag"
or any tag name. we dont use @ with text only [text()='the text value'] because it is not an attribute

if 2 or more elements have same attribute and attribute value, Selenium will only interact with the first element it locates

node=is a each line in our dom
