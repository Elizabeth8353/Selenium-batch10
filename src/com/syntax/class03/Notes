Why do we need X-path or Css Selector?
--developers will not provide all the locators in html
--by using xpath and css selectors we can identify elements with any given attribute

What is an Xpath ?
-xpath is a like query language which helps us to identify elements
uniquely on the webpage

Types of xpath:
Absolute xpath-->Starts from the starting node in html (not comenly used because website might change and nodes might be deleted or added
it always starts with single slash (/)
e.g /html/head (or body because since they are sibilings we can't do html/head/body because body is not inside head and viseversa )
if we want to skip a div(sibiling) e.g =/html/body/div/div[2]  use index
/div(or div[2] to go to second sibiling div)

Relative XPath:
Relative Xpath starts from any node in html it starts with double slash ( //)
Syntax for Relative x-path:
//tagName[@attribute='atributeValue']
e.g  input[@id='email']

Identifying elements by its text:
//tagName[text()='textValue']

e.g a[text()='Create New Account']

identify by using contains method
Contains:
//tagName[contains(@attribute,'partialAttributeValue')]
example: //input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')]

Starts with:
-will identify the element with starting partial value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute,'partial starting attribute value')]
example:
//button[starts-with(@data-testid,'royal')]  using attribute
//button[starts-with(text(),'Log In')]      using text

Ends-with was used in xpath 1.0 we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

<div> Division (basically contains webelement)
<img> Image
<h> header
<p> paragraph
<li> List
<ul> unordered list
<ol> order List

Advance Xpath
is based on parent and child and sibiling and ansestor relationships
parent is the container that holds our child elements
ancestor anything above the parent

-identifying elements by fallowing sibiling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::tagname
ex.//input[@id='calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

- Identifying elements by Proceding sibiling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::tagname
exmp: //span[text()='& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

-Identify element parent
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::parentTagname
exmp: //span[text()='& Orders']/parent::a

-To ansestor
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/ancestor::ancestorTagname
exmp:// input[@name='email']/ancestor::form

identify element by index
(//img[@class='ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
