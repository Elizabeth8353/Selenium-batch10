implicit wait:
will be applied for findelement() method

Explicit wait or Webdriver wait:
is used to tell the webdriver to wait for a certain condition before throwing an exception for a specified condition

Explicit wait works with ExpectedConditions class and waits until a certain conditions are met or the given time is achived

h= headers when they have h1 h2 h3 they get changed during the development of the application they usually get changed
so try not to use it in general instead use wild card * instead of the tag name the * identifies any tag name can be replace
by any tag name

* sign in xpath is a wild card which can identify any tag name
 //*[contains(text(),'Welcome')]

Fluent wait --> consider as a global just like explicit
its used to tell Webdriver to wait for certain condition as well as it's frequency
before throwing an exception
